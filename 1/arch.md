# Kubernetes Components

🧠 Kubernetes Components Explained

📍 I. CONTROL PLANE COMPONENTS

These components make global decisions about the cluster (like scheduling), and detect and respond to cluster events (like starting a new pod when a deployment’s replicas field is unsatisfied).

⸻

1. kube-apiserver
	•	📌 Role: The front-end (entry point) for the Kubernetes control plane.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	Exposes the Kubernetes API (REST interface).
	•	Accepts commands from kubectl, other control plane components, or clients.
	•	Validates and processes REST requests, updates etcd, and communicates with other components.

✅ Highly available — you can run multiple kube-apiserver instances.

⸻

2. etcd
	•	📌 Role: The key-value store used by Kubernetes to store all cluster data.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	Stores the state of the entire cluster: nodes, pods, configs, secrets, etc.
	•	Highly consistent and reliable.
	•	It’s the single source of truth for Kubernetes.

💡 Think of etcd as the “database” of Kubernetes.

⸻

3. kube-scheduler
	•	📌 Role: Schedules pods onto nodes.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	Watches for unscheduled pods.
	•	Selects a node based on resource availability, taints, affinity rules, etc.
	•	Writes its decision (node assignment) back to the API server.

✅ Only assigns pods to nodes, doesn’t actually start them.

⸻

4. kube-controller-manager
	•	📌 Role: Runs controller processes.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	A controller is a loop that watches the desired state in the cluster and ensures the actual state matches.
	•	Manages:
	•	Node controller
	•	Replication controller
	•	Deployment controller
	•	Namespace controller
	•	Service account controller

💬 All these controllers are bundled into a single binary (kube-controller-manager), running as one process.

⸻

5. cloud-controller-manager (optional, for cloud-based clusters)
	•	📌 Role: Manages cloud-specific control logic.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	Interacts with cloud provider APIs.
	•	Manages:
	•	Node lifecycle in the cloud (e.g., adding/removing VMs)
	•	Load balancers
	•	Storage volumes

☁️ Required only when running Kubernetes on a cloud like AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.

⸻

🖥️ II. NODE (WORKER) COMPONENTS

These run on every node (physical or virtual machine) in the cluster and are responsible for managing containers.

⸻

6. kubelet
	•	📌 Role: The agent that runs on each node.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	Receives instructions from the API server.
	•	Ensures containers in pods are running and healthy.
	•	Watches the PodSpecs assigned to its node and reports back status.

💬 It does not create containers directly — it talks to container runtimes (like containerd or Docker).

⸻

7. kube-proxy
	•	📌 Role: Manages networking for pods and services.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	Maintains network rules on each node.
	•	Implements service discovery and load balancing.
	•	Forwards traffic to the correct pod IPs.

🧠 Uses iptables, ipvs, or eBPF under the hood to route traffic.

⸻

8. Container Runtime
	•	📌 Role: Runs containers on each node.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	Starts, stops, and manages containers.
	•	Interfaces with the kubelet.

🔧 Examples:
	•	containerd ✅ (default in many distributions)
	•	CRI-O
	•	Docker (deprecated for production use with Kubernetes ≥ 1.24)

⸻

🔄 III. OTHER IMPORTANT INTERNAL COMPONENTS

9. CoreDNS
	•	📌 Role: Internal DNS service for the cluster.
	•	📄 Function:
	•	Resolves internal service names (e.g., my-service.default.svc.cluster.local) into IPs.
	•	Allows service discovery.

⸻

10. Add-ons (Optional but Common)
	•	📄 Add functionality like monitoring, logging, dashboard, etc.
	•	Metrics-server – collects resource usage metrics.
	•	Kubernetes Dashboard – web UI.
	•	Flannel / Calico / Cilium – for container networking (CNI plugins).
	•	Ingress Controller – like NGINX Ingress, to manage external access.
